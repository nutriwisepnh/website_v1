Do you want to improve your eating habits, but feel lost with all the contradictory information available? I have a No-Fad, No-Nonsense approach to eating well, and base my advice on science-backed principles about nutrition.

In this nutrition consultation package you will get insights in your current dietary habits, learn about your needs, and if applicable, what to change to reach your goals in a healthy and sustainable way. I will provide you with some guidance to kick start a truly healthy diet.

**How it works:**

Before our consultation I will send you an intake assessment form and ask you to record your food and beverages for 3 days, so I will get to know you a bit, and get an idea about your current dietary habits and goals. I will calculate your current nutrition intake, and assess how your diet compares to science-based recommendations that are specific to your age, sex and activity level and summarize the results in a written report.

We will review your diet analysis results together in a consult and create a personalized plan to change elements of your diet, based on your needs and a realistic assessment of what you would like to change.  

**This package includes:**

1. Introductory 30 min call
*Informal chat in which I will explain how the service works and answer your questions.
2. Intake assessment 
*An online intake assessment to collect some information about your lifestyle and dietary habits.
*3-day food record
3. A report detailing your nutrient analysis and recommendations for improvement.
4. Consult (45 min)
