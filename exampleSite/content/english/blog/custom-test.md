As you can see there is the option for a lunch and/or dinner meal plan, and a full-day plan that includes breakfast and snacks. See below for more information.
 
 

### Custom A

#### Nourish Bowls

The tailor-made meals in this plan are based on a mix-and-match principle to create nourishing bowls for lunch and/or dinner. With around **10 base ingredients**, combined with **50+ toppings,** we offer a wide array of different ingredients which together will make up the meals. The plan prioritizes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, to provide you with an nutritious foundation, assisting in your dietary goals.

### Custom B

#### VIP plan

This plan builds upon the Nourish Bowls, but as an addition it includes breakfast and snacks. The entire daily menu will be based on your recommended nutrient profile, and can be adjusted whenever needed.

Your daily menu will be delivered to you in the evening, so you can have a great nutritious start the next day.
