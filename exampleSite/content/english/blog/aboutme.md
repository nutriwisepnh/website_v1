Hi My name is Melanie and I provide evidence based nutrition consulting. 

We're constantly overwhelmed with contradicting diet and nutrition advise, to the point we don't know what to eat anymore. Most of what we hear is distorted, it wants to sell you something - a miracle water, the lastest fad diet book or an unnecessary food supplement. 

With my academic education in nutritional sciences (BSc and MSc, Nutritional Physiology and Health status, Wageningen University, The Netherlands), I take a simple and sustainable approach to nutrition. A healthy diet shouldn't be about restriction and deprivation, but prioritizes variety, balance and moderation.

If you are looking for a healthier lifestyle, or have specific (fitness) goals; let's get in touch!
